# FixFinder - Online Home Repair and Maintenance Service

## Description
FixFinder is a database project developed for the "Advanced Database" course at the College of Management and Technology â€“ Cairo. The project simulates an online platform connecting homeowners with skilled professionals for home repair and maintenance services. It aims to streamline the process of finding reliable service providers by addressing issues like trustworthiness, inefficiencies, and lack of transparent pricing. The project encompasses database design (EER/RDM), creation (DDL), data manipulation (DML), querying (DQL), data control (DCL), and procedural logic (PL/SQL).

## Features
*   **Database Design:** Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) and Relational Model (RDM) illustrating the database structure.
*   **Database Creation (DDL):** Scripts to create all necessary tables, including relationships and constraints.
*   **Data Population (DML):** Scripts to insert sample data into the tables for testing and demonstration.
*   **Data Retrieval (DQL):** A suite of SQL queries to extract meaningful information, demonstrate database functionality, and answer specific business questions.
*   **Data Control (DCL):** Examples of role creation and permission management.
*   **Procedural Logic (PL/SQL):** Demonstrations of stored procedures or blocks for more complex operations.
